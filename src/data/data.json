There was a specific report in the client website that lacked important information. To solve the problem I researched different internal API's, found the best and added its data to the report. This included authentication with a bearer token and creating the data structures in C# to represent the API response. I also added error handling in several locations so the backend would handle the situation, were the API to be unresponsive.",

Using PHP parameter binding, I encapsulated the data before running the SQL query. This improved security by preventing SQL injection and soved the problem now that the input data would not interfere with the query. The local development was done in a docker container and the code was deployed to a Linux server running a LAMP (Apache, MySQL, & PHP) stack.",
